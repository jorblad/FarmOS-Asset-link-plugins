Asset-link plugins for farmOS

I have created a plugin for adding harvest logs for plants that let you choose what unit you measure in.

Under seeds is a plugin for regristering newly bought seeds. It depends on the farm_ledger module to register the price and creating a purchase log.

I also modified a observerainfall plugin to measure rainfall in mm instead of inches.
